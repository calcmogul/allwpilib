### Reverse accumulation automatic differentiation

In reverse accumulation AD, the dependent variable to be differentiated is fixed
and the derivative is computed with respect to each subexpression recursively.
In a pen-and-paper calculation, the derivative of the outer functions is
repeatedly substituted in the chain rule:

(∂y/∂x) = (∂y/∂w₁) * (∂w₁/∂x) = ((∂y/∂w₂) * (∂w₂/∂w₁)) * (∂w₁/∂x) = ...

In reverse accumulation, the quantity of interest is the adjoint, denoted with a
bar (w̄); it is a derivative of a chosen dependent variable with respect to a
subexpression w: ∂y/∂w.

Given the expression f(x₁,x₂)=sin(x₁) + x₁x₂, the computational graph is:

               f(x₁,x₂)
                  |
                  w₅     w₅=w₄+w₃
                 /  \
                /    \
 w₄=sin(w₁)    w₄     w₃    w₃=w₁w₂
               |   /  |
     w₁=x₁     w₁     w₂    w₂=x₃

The operations to compute the derivative:

w̄₅ = 1 (seed)
w̄₄ = w̄₅(∂w₅/∂w₄) = w̄₅
w̄₃ = w̄₅(∂w₅/∂w₃) = w̄₅
w̄₂ = w̄₃(∂w₃/∂w₂) = w̄₃w₁
w̄₁ = w̄₄(∂w₄/∂w₁) + w̄₃(∂w₃/∂w₁) = w̄₄cos(w₁) + w̄₃w₂
